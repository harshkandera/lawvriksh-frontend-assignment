# Cover Note

This project is the **LawVriksh Frontend Assignment** implemented in **React.js** with TailwindCSS and Recharts.  
The dashboard replicates the provided Figma design, ensuring both **visual hierarchy** and **usability**.

**Phase 1** focused on layout and responsiveness:  
- Created a grid-based layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
- Grouped related data into modular cards.  

**Phase 2** added interactions and feedback:  
- Hover states, transitions, and tooltips.  
- Animated charts for Website Visitors and Revenue.  
- Applied UX laws (Fitts’s, Hick’s, Proximity, Feedback) to improve usability.  

The final result is a **responsive, interactive dashboard** delivered as a public GitHub repo and deployable via Vercel/Netlify.
